# Python Project Template

![Banner showing uv package manager logo plus Python logo equals "Python ready to go"](x_docs/images/readme-banner.jpg)

A [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)-based Python 3.14+ project template configured for test-driven development (pytest) and code quality checks (Ruff, Pyright). These run automatically every time you commit.

Supports development in [`src/`](src/) packages, standalone [`scripts/`](scripts/), and Jupyter [`notebooks/`](notebooks/). Complete IDE setup included for VSCode/Cursor ([extensions](.vscode/extensions.json), [settings](.vscode/settings.json)).

## 📁 Project Structure

Key project directories and files:

| | Name | Description |

| 📂 | .venv/ | Virtual environment created by `uv sync` (gitignored) |
| 📂 | [.vscode/](.vscode/) | [extensions](.vscode/extensions.json) for VSCode/Cursor and IDE [settings](.vscode/settings.json) |
| 📂 | [notebooks/](notebooks/) | Jupyter notebooks |
| 📂 | [scripts/](scripts/) | Standalone utility scripts |
| 📂 | [src/uv_template/](src/uv_template/) | Package source code |
| 📂 | [tests/](tests/) | Test files mirroring src/ structure |
| 📄 | [.gitattributes](.gitattributes) | Git line-ending, diff, and notebook filter settings |
| 📄 | [.gitignore](.gitignore) | Files excluded from version control |
| 📄 | [.markdownlint.yaml](.markdownlint.yaml) | Markdown linting configuration |
| 📄 | [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) | Automated quality checks before each commit |
| 📄 | [.python-version](.python-version) | Python version specification for uv |
| 📄 | [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) | Project dependencies and tool configuration |
| 📄 | [README.md](README.md) | This file |
| 📄 | [uv.lock](uv.lock) | Dependency versions (do not edit manually) |

## 📦 Installation

1. Prerequisite: install the uv Python package manager [from here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. Clone the repository to "my-project-name"

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/michellepace/uv-template.git my-project-name
   ```

3. Run these terminal commands for first-time setup:

    ```bash
    # Change directory into new project
    cd my-project-name

    # Install project dependencies (creates .venv/ directory)
    uv sync

    # Install pre-commit hooks (runs quality checks before each commit)
    uv run pre-commit install
    ```

4. Open "my-project-name" in your IDE and open a new terminal (so it picks up the virtual environment):
   - Run `which python` → should show a path ending in `.venv/bin/python`
   - Run `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` → linting, type checking, and tests should pass

5. Install the recommended extensions from [.vscode/extensions.json](.vscode/extensions.json). These are already configured in [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json).

6. Open [`notebooks/example.ipynb`](notebooks/example.ipynb), select the `.venv` Python interpreter, and run it.

7. [Set up Jupyter Git integration (Recommended)](#-jupyter-notebook-git-integration-recommended) — keeps notebook outputs out of version control while preserving them locally.

## 📓 Jupyter Notebook Git Integration (Recommended)

This project uses [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) to keep notebooks clean in Git. It automatically strips cell outputs and metadata when committing, so you get:

- **Cleaner diffs** — only code changes, not output noise
- **Smaller repos** — no large binary outputs bloating history
- **Fewer merge conflicts** — outputs don't clash between branches
- **No re-running after commits** — your local notebook keeps its outputs; only the version sent to Git is stripped

**One-time global setup** (works for all your current and future repos with notebooks):

```bash
# Install nbstripout as a global uv tool
uv tool install nbstripout

# Configure Git to use it globally
nbstripout --install --global

# To remove later: nbstripout --uninstall --global && uv tool uninstall nbstripout
```

Any repo with `*.ipynb filter=nbstripout` in `.gitattributes` (like this one) will now automatically strip outputs on commit.

## ✨ Make It Yours

Use AI prompts to quickly adapt this template to your project:

1. Instruct AI (renaming): *Refactor this project to consistently rename it from "uv-template" to "my-project-name" throughout. Use `git mv` for renaming!*

2. Instruct AI (changes): *I will not be using Jupyter notebooks in this project. Remove all notebook-related files, references, and dependencies throughout.*

3. Manually refine [.claude/CLAUDE.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md) to suit your preferences and project.
