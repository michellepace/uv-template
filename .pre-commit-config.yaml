# Notes:
# 1. `uv-lock` hook automatically updates the lockfile to ensure it matches specs in pyproject.toml
# 2. `ruff-format` runs before `ruff-check` (format then lint)
# 3. `--exit-non-zero-on-fix` flag blocks commits when ruff makes automatic fixes, must review first
# 4. `pyright` runs type checking to catch type errors before commits
# 5. `pass_filenames: false` makes pytest run all tests rather than only testing modified files
